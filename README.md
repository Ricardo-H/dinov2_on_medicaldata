# DinoV2 Medical Dataset Usage Example

## Introduction
This repository contains a Python Jupyter Notebook file that documents how I used `DinoV2` to perform `10-fold cross` training and validation on a medical dataset.

## File Structure
- `main.ipynb`: The main file containing all the steps and code for performing 10-fold cross-training and validation using DinoV2.

## Configuration
You can control the code by changing the content of the `cfg` variable at the top of the notebook. Adjusting the keys in this variable allows for flexible configuration of the training and validation process.
